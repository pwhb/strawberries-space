  "m-title": "Our Mission",
  "m": {
    "m1": "Homeless people are dying every single day due to countless easily preventable causes. You can't even google how many victims are out there because this sick world never give a fuck about whatever happens to the poor. But you don't need a genius IQ to see the countless ways the homeless are being oppressed.",
    "m2": "Who is really responsible for the poor souls that experience unfair struggles everyday just to not die and yet eventually face premature death anyway? Themselves for not having a job like a typical slave living in a home? Of course, because homeless people always had the same chances as the privileged like you and me! Of course, it's totally fair to expect a homeless person to afford pointless bullshits like a respectable look or education to get hired and lick the capitalists' dick. Of course, it's because the homeless are lazy.",
    "m3": "Homeless people aren't the only victims of the sick concept known as real estate. Everyone that is living in a rental home is also a victim. The only reason why people with an average income can't afford to buy a home is because the landlords are monopolizing the houses. Housing is a universal right for everyone. If you have anything against this, you're an unforgivable fascist and you deserve to be guillotined too.",
    "m4": "Landlords are literally cold-blooded homicidal fascist cowards. The hands of landlords are stained with the blood of the innocent that suffered and died poor and unknown and the working class that sacrificed their whole lives working to pay rent. Every second a landlord chooses not to stop being a landlord, the human civilization gets one step closer to its end.",
    "m5": "Our mission is very wholesome and simple. Guillotine all landlords! Because it's the first step to make the world less ugly and not because we hold grudges. No one really has a home until all landlords are guillotined. We're all homeless as long as one person remains unsheltered. For either every is free or nobody is free. For either everyone is home or nobody is home. One less landlord's head at a time and eventually we will have our home back!"
